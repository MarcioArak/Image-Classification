# Image-Classification

This is an image classification model with Deep Learning using tensorflow. The application takes training data of images that are categorized by the name of the folders and later predicts which category does the image belong to. For this example I will be using sport balls because they are similar in shape and can vary in appearance to see if the machine can detect the differance.

This notebook goes through the steps of making a model from scratch. It shows how to evaluate a model using k-cross validation in addition to showing how to plot performance and statistics.

## Overview

This notebook is my first Deep Learning experience following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc). The purpose of this project is to learn more about AI and Machine Learning by writing down all the steps it takes to make and test a model, while also taking notes of my deep learning experience.
